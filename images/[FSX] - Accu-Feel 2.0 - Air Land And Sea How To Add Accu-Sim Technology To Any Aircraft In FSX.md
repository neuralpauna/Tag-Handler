If you are a fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), you may have heard of Accu-Feel, a revolutionary add-on that brings a new level of realism and immersion to your flight simulation. Accu-Feel is developed by A2A Simulations, a company that specializes in creating high-fidelity aircraft models with their own Accu-Sim technology. Accu-Sim bypasses the default FSX systems and replaces them with its own coding, providing a more authentic and dynamic simulation of aircraft behavior, performance, and sound.

Accu-Feel v.2 Air, Land & Sea is the latest version of this add-on, and it offers a "touch" of Accu-Sim to any aircraft in your FSX collection, whether it is default or third-party. Accu-Feel v.2 hooks into the lower core of FSX using Accu-Sim technology, and does not interfere or alter any files in the FSX directory. This means it is compatible with any aircraft and any other add-ons you may have installed.
 
Accu-Feel v.2 allows you to customize various aspects of your aircraft's physics, sound, and effects, such as ground handling, turbulence, wind noise, stall buffet, drag effects, tire scrub, water physics, and more. You can adjust these settings using an easy-to-use in-game user interface that pops up when you press Shift+9. You can also save different profiles for different aircraft types, such as tricycle or tail dragger, jet or propeller, amphibian or landplane.
